// TableBuilder provides the interface used to build a Table
// (an immutable and sorted map from keys to values).
//
// Multiple threads can invoke const methods on a TableBuilder without
// external synchronization, but if any of the threads may call a
// non-const method, all threads accessing the same TableBuilder must use
// external synchronization.
