// Class that provides access to a LevelDB. Note that this class is frequently
// instantiated on the stack and then destroyed again, so instantiation has to
// be very cheap. Unfortunately that means, a CTxDB instance is actually just a
// wrapper around some global state.
//
// A LevelDB is a key/value store that is optimized for fast usage on hard
// disks. It prefers long read/writes to seeks and is based on a series of
// sorted key/value mapping files that are stacked on top of each other, with
// newer files overriding older files. A background thread compacts them
// together when too many files stack up.
